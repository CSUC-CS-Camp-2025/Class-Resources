  <p>
    HTML syntax uses tags and often you might see that some use a start tag and an end tag (Ex. this paragraph) while others only appear once like the image and break tag.
    When it comes to tags like paragraph, header, div, and list they can contain content which makes it necessary to know when and where it ends hence a need for a closing tag.
    For the other types they inherently cant contain anything and are typically only edited within the starting tag.
